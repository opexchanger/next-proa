    'Somewhere between “the best things come in small packages” and “the things worth having don’t come easy” you will find the White Mountains of New Hampshire. They are petite in comparison to some other mountain ranges, cracking just 6,000 feet at their highest point. For example, total ascent here is a mere 14,819 feet (4,517 meters), less than half than on the Tour du Mont Blanc or Walker’s Haute Route. But the White Mountains pack a mighty punch, challenging hikers with thigh-shattering ascents and knee-compressing descents over rocky, ankle-twisting terrain. Embrace the challenge, though, and you will be rewarded with incomparable views of the New England landscape, unique and beautiful plant life and a renowned hut system staffed by the Appalachian Mountain Club’s lively “croo.”',

    'Our standard itinerary includes 8 stages that span a tough 41 miles (65 km) up and down (and up and down) this rugged terrain. Hikers familiar with the Appalachian Trail will know that this hike makes up a portion of the Appalachian Trail running through New Hampshire, and is therefore connected spiritually, though no longer physically, to the West Highland Way as part of the larger International Appalachian Trail. Designers of the trail had apparently never heard of switchbacks, preferring instead to climb and descend straight up and down the mountainside. No exception was made for the White Mountains’ steep slopes. The trail in this region spends more time above the treeline than any other part of the Appalachian Trail, so hikers can take in spectacular views of the surrounding countryside when not being abused by sometimes spectacularly bad weather. Above the treeline, the terrain is more like the Arctic tundra, including hardy plant life specially adapted to this environment. Robbins’ cinquefoil, for example, grows here and nowhere else on Earth. ',
